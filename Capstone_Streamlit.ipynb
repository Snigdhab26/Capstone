The primary outcome measure was endothelial function assessed by change in flow mediated dilation (FMD) RESULTS: Our meta-analysis included 22 studies with a total of 1472 patients. Our pooled analysis shows that allopurinol significantly improved FMD (WMD = 1.46%, 95% CI [0.70, 2.22], p < 0.01) compared to control. However, there was no significant difference between allopurinol and control for endothelial-independent vasodilation measured by forearm blood flow (WMD = 0.10%, 95% CI [- 0.89, 0.69], p = 0.80). Subgroup analysis indicated that the effect of allopurinol on FMD was more significant in diabetic and congestive heart failure patients.\n",

            "With the rapid development of China's economic level, great changes have taken place in people's diet structure, gout has become a common disease that puzzles people's health, seriously affects the realization of China's \"Healthy China\" strategic goal. Gouty arthritis (GA) is a common joint disease caused by chronic purine metabolism disorder. Currently, drugs used to treat GA are allopurinol and colchicine. However, these drugs can only temporarily relieve the clinical symptoms of GA with significant side effects. More and more basic and clinical studies have confirmed that Traditional Chinese medicine has definite curative effect on GA.\n",
            "To elucidate the potential molecular mechanism of Tongfengkang (TFK) in the treatment of GA, and to provide experimental basis for the search and development of efficient and low-toxicity Chinese medicine for GA treatment.\n",
            "Aqueous extract of TFK (AETFK) were determined by liquid phase high resolution mass spectrometry and the possible effective constituents were screened out. Acute GA model rats were established to detect the anti-inflammatory and detumification effects of AETFK on GA and explore the potential mechanism. The effect of AETFK on serum uric acid and urinary uric acid levels in acute GA rats was determined by automatic biochemical analyzer, and the effect of AETFK on the expression of acute GA-related immunoinflammatory factors were determined by protein thermal fluorescence chip. The effect of AETFK on the concentration of neutrophils in the joint fluid of acute GA rats were determined by Reichs-Giemsa staining. The effect of AETFK on macrophage activation was detected by ELISA. In order to further investigate the mechanism of AETFK in the treatment of GA, a rat model of hyperuricemia was established to detect the effect of AETFK on the level of uric acid in hyperuricemia model rats. Biochemical indexes of liver and kidney and hematoxylin-eosin staining (HE) were used to evaluate the effects of AETFK on the organs, and to preliminatively evaluate the safety of ventilation confufang.\n",
            "Compared with the model group, the joint swelling degree of GA rats in AETFK treatment group were significantly reduced, and the levels of blood uric acid and urine uric acid were also significantly decreased. Protein thermal fluorescence microarray results showed that the levels of gout - related inflammatory factors in GA rats in AETFK treatment group were significantly lower than those in control group. Reichsen-giemsa staining and ELISA showed that AETFK could reduce the activation of macrophages and the accumulation of neutrophils in the joint fluid. The results of liver and kidney biochemical indexes and HE staining showed that no obvious tissue damage was observed in the organs of rats treated with AETFK.\n",
            "AETFK not only has significant anti-inflammatory effects on GA, but also can significantly reduce the level of blood uric acid in GA rats, without obvious toxic and side effects. These effects may be related to AETFK's inhibition of neutrophil enrichment and macrophage activation during early inflammation.\n",
            "Febuxostat, initially developed as a xanthine oxidase inhibitor to address hyperuricemia in gout patients, has evolved into a versatile therapeutic agent with multifaceted applications. This review provides a comprehensive overview of febuxostat's mechanism of action, its effectiveness in gout management, its cardiovascular safety profile, renal and hepatic effects, musculoskeletal applications, safety considerations, and emerging research prospects. Febuxostat's primary mechanism involves selective inhibition of xanthine oxidase, resulting in reduced uric acid production. Its pharmacokinetics require personalized dosing strategies based on individual characteristics. In gout management, febuxostat offers a compelling alternative, effectively lowering uric acid levels, relieving symptoms, and supporting long-term control, especially for patients intolerant to allopurinol. Recent studies have demonstrated its cardiovascular safety, and it exhibits minimal hepatotoxicity, making it suitable for those with liver comorbidities. Febuxostat's potential nephroprotective effects and kidney stone prevention properties are noteworthy, particularly for gout patients with renal concerns. Beyond gout, its anti-inflammatory properties hint at applications in musculoskeletal conditions and a broader spectrum of clinical contexts, including metabolic syndrome. Emerging research explores febuxostat's roles in cardiovascular health, neurological disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer therapy, driven by its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties. Future directions include personalized medicine, combination therapies, mechanistic insights, and ongoing long-term safety monitoring, collectively illuminating the promising landscape of febuxostat's multifaceted therapeutic potential.\n",
            "This feasibility study aimed to assess the acceptability of using smartphone notifications to modify the medication beliefs of people with gout. We evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of a smartphone application using the Technology Acceptance Model. We explored adherence rate differences and outcomes between the intervention and control groups.\n",
            "Fifty-two patients with gout who were prescribed allopurinol were randomly assigned to either active control (n = 24) or intervention group (n = 28). Over 3 months, both groups used the study app on their smartphones. The active control group received notifications about general health advice, whereas the intervention group received adherence-targeted notifications. The feasibility and acceptability of the smartphone app was measured through semistructured interviews. Adherence rate was assessed through serum urate levels and missed doses at 3 timepoints: baseline, 3 months (post intervention), and 6 months (follow-up).\n",
            "The smartphone app demonstrated high feasibility, with strong participant retention and compliance. The participants expressed high levels of satisfaction with the app's user-friendliness and content, highlighting its acceptability. Both groups showed a significant reduction in missed doses over time (\n",
            "Adherence-targeted notifications have the potential to be an effective and scalable approach to supporting medication adherence in patients with gout. Further research is needed with larger samples to refine the components of the intervention and explore its optimal implementation.\n",
            "Myeloid malignancies are a group of blood disorders characterized by the proliferation of one or more haematopoietic myeloid cell lineages, predominantly in the bone marrow, and are often caused by aberrant protein tyrosine kinase activity. The protein tyrosine phosphatase CD45 is a trans-membrane molecule expressed on all haemopoietic blood cells except that of platelets and red cells. CD45 regulates various cellular physiological processes including proliferation, apoptosis, and lymphocyte activation. However, its role in chemotherapy response is still unknown; therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of CD45 in myeloid malignancies in terms of cellular growth, apoptosis, and response to chemotherapy. The expression of CD45 on myeloid leukaemia primary cells and cell lines was heterogeneous with HEL and OCI-AML3 cells showing the highest level. Inhibition of CD45 resulted in increased cellular sensitivity to cytarabine and ruxolitinib, the two main therapies for AML and MPN. Bioinformatics analysis identified genes whose expression was correlated with CD45 expression such as JAK2, ACTR2, THAP3 Serglycin, and PBX-1 genes, as well as licensed drugs (alendronate, allopurinol, and balsalazide), which could be repurposed as CD45 inhibitors which effectively increases sensitivity to cytarabine and ruxolitinib at low doses. Therefore, CD45 inhibition could be explored as a potential therapeutic partner for treatment of myeloid malignancies in combination with chemotherapy such as cytarabine especially for elderly patients and those showing chemotherapy resistance.\n",

            "A systematic review of published randomized controlled trials on URAT1 inhibitors was conducted to investigate the incidence of renal safety events. A model-based analysis was performed to predict the uric acid-lowering efficacy of representative URAT1 inhibitors.\n",
            "The overall renal safety event incidences of lesinurad, verinurad, dotinurad, SHR4640, and benzbromarone in patients with hyperuricemia were 11.2 % (142/1264), 12.0 % (34/284), 0.5 % (2/421), 2.3 % (5/213), and 1.3 % (5/393), respectively. A semi-mechanistic pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model was used to establish the dose-exposure-effect relationship of lesinurad, verinurad, dotinurad, and SHR4640 with or without the combination of xanthine oxidase inhibitors (XOIs). The efficacy ranking of the intermediate dose of URAT1 inhibitors with once-daily dosing was 2 mg dotinurad > 10 mg verinurad > 5 mg SHR4640 > 400 mg lesinurad. The combination of 80 mg febuxostat and 600 mg allopurinol reduced the 24-h cumulative renal uric acid excretion by 48.4 % and 48.3 %, respectively.\n",
            "Uric acid-lowering efficacy is not an independent factor for the renal safety risk of different URAT1 inhibitors, and structural differences could be responsible for the difference. The adverse renal effects of URAT1 inhibitors are dose-dependent, and the combination with high doses of XOIs can significantly reduce the renal safety risk by reducing uric acid excretion by the kidneys.\n",
